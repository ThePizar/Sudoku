# Sudoku
Sudoku solver with a GUI. 

This sudoku solver is currently capable of solving easy and medium level sudoku.
It is currently being rewritten for better organization and readability. 
Afterwards it will be update to be able to solve harder sudokus.
The end goal is to allow for this program to be adaptable enough to handle alternate sudoku for like 6x6 or mutant sudokus.
